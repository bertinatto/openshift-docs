= Overview

With the automatic CSI migration feature enabled, persistent volumes provisioned using in-tree storage plug-ins supported by this feature are migrated to their counterpart CSI drivers.

This process does not involve any data migration, {product-title} only translates the persistent volume object in-memory. As a result, the translated persistent volume object is not stored on disk, nor its contents is changed.

The following drivers are supported:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

* OpenStack Cinder

* Azure Disk

* Azure File

* Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk (in-tree) and Google Cloud Platform Persistent Disk (CSI)

* VMware vSphere

CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Enabling this feature does not change how you use all existing API objects (for example, `PersistentVolumes`, `PersistentVolumeClaims`, and `StorageClasses`).

By default, automatic migration is enabled for Azure Disk and OpenStack Cinder.

[IMPORTANT]
====
CSI automatic migration will be enabled by default for all storage plug-ins in a future {product-title} release, so it is highly recommended that you test it now and report any issues.
