= Enabling CSI automatic migration

[NOTE]
====
Enabling CSI automatic migration drains, and then restarts, all nodes in the cluster in sequence. This might take some time.
====

CSI automatic migration is enabled by default for Azure Disk and OpenStack Cinder. The remaining storage plug-ins require an additional procedure.

.Procedure

* Enable feature gates (see _Nodes -> Enabling features using feature gates_).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After turning on Technology Preview features using feature gates, they cannot be turned off. As a result, cluster upgrades are prevented.
====
+
The following configuration example enables CSI automatic migration to all CSI drivers supported by this feature:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade <1>
...
----
<1> Enables automatic migration for AWS EBS, GCP, Azure File, and VMware vSphere.
+
You can specify CSI automatic migration for a selected CSI driver by setting `CustomNoUpgrade` `featureSet` and for `featuregates` to one of the following:
+
--
* CSIMigrationAWS

* CSIMigrationAzureFile

* CSIMigrationGCE

* CSIMigrationvSphere
--
+
The following configuration example enables automatic migration to the AWS EBS CSI driver only:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: CustomNoUpgrade
  customNoUpgrade:
    enabled:
      - CSIMigrationAWS <1>
    ...
----
<1> Enables automatic migration for AWS EBS only.
